    "paragraph": "The Brazilian carrot cake, or \"bolo de cenoura\" in Portuguese, is one of the most traditional Brazilian cake recipes. The special chocolate ganache on top (called \"brigadeiro\") is key to this beloved dessert. We would tipically eat it in the afternoon with a cup of coffee. But today we have a great excuse to grab a cuppa instead and taste this and other amazing bakes at Pride Afternoon Tea!",
